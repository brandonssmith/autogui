Sample python script using pyautogui for web automation

This is a sample script using pyautogui to automate a web interface. I have used pyautogui often in my business practices as a sort 
of "on the go" RPA script automator.  True, TagUI is better but not always needed.  This script is fairly simple and you are free 
to use it, copy it, modify it at your own risk.
